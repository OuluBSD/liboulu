# LocalHMD
This package contains forked code from OpenHMD. The initial reason for forking was the lack of accelerometer data from a WMR headset. The choice of forking is justified by better debugging ability. This won't be a maintaining burden, because native (and openhmd?) libraries are used for the release quality software.
