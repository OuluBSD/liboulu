 - Register shader components to pipeline
	- some CpuNative virtual function
 - Transfer model & mesh to pipeline memory
	- and back to model
 - Initial GpuPipeline
	- Enable non-conforming renderer (completely custom pipeline)

 - reuse vtx data always in MinimalVertexLoaderShader

 - use only 1-byte indices
	- split 3d models to meshlets


 - flags for shaders:
	- overwrites vertices
	- can use old cached stage
	- etc
